# @gentorial/runtime-vue

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 2de2203: Store completed follow-ups as a selectable conversation tree and add a lightweight learning-path view made of connected points. Selecting an earlier point changes the active root-to-node context, and the next ordinary follow-up creates a child from that point. Point tooltips expose the corresponding question on hover and keyboard focus.
- 2de2203: Add independent context and generation resource limits. The runtime rejects over-budget active paths without trimming conversation history, managed handlers enforce request/input/follow-up/output limits before caching, streams stop on oversized output, and provider generators accept a portable maximum output token setting.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Persist successful generated lessons, follow-up conversations, and expanded state when runtime persistence is enabled.

### Patch Changes

- Use Lucide for standard action icons and align inline generation controls on one compact visual track.
- Align the reusable VitePress preferences flow with the Gentorial website: use the same three-column option cards, BYOK field order, Geist typography, translucent blurred overlay, control geometry, selected states, navigation, and responsive layout.
- Add an explicit course option and scaffolding prompt for rendering raw AI-generated HTML.
- Allow sites to persist learner preferences and, when explicitly enabled, BYOK credentials in browser storage.
- Preserve safe Markdown table structure and column alignment in generated lessons.
- Render generated code fences with VitePress-compatible Shiki highlighting, copy controls, language labels, and optional line numbers.
- Render generation failures inline with an accessible message and a red result edge.
- 1bb4bd4: Preserve generated structure by treating browser streams as standard Markdown. Runtime Markdown is incrementally parsed into safe Vue nodes, retains its source through follow-up conversations and copy actions, and delegates Mermaid fences to the default VitePress theme without exposing author-defined custom containers to AI generation. Add a framework-neutral Web Standards server adapter with JSON lessons, SSE Markdown, authorization, error transport, and cancellation propagation.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Allow learners to configure the model and Base URL for every browser BYOK provider while preserving the legacy full-endpoint option. Browser BYOK now supports incremental SSE output for initial lessons and follow-up answers. Remove generated-content validation and its extension hooks; accuracy and grounding remain prompt context while the runtime confines output to controlled renderers.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Publish the first usable Gentorial framework release, including the interactive scaffolder, VitePress integration, learner preferences, BYOK generation pipeline, and default tutorial UI.
